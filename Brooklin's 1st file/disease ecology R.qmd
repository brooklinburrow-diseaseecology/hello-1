![](EpiTriad.png)
The Epidemiologic Triad illustrates how the interactions among the host, pathogen, and environment shape disease outcomes. Disease emergence, prevalence, and transmission depend on these three components aligning in ways that support pathogen survival and spread. Changes in any one of these factors can alter disease dynamics.

WORKSHEET 2

1. Find the sample size necessary to detect a disease at or above 5% prevalence in a herd of 5000 deer @95% CONFIDENCE
			59

2. Using the hypergeometric distribution, compare the sample size requirements for the following scenarios:
	a. 95% confidence in detecting a disease at 1% prevalence in a large population: 299
	b.99% confidence in detecting a disease at 2% prevalence in a large population: 229
	Both are close to the same number because, even as the confidence level increases, fewer animals are needed for sampling. You are looking for a higher prevalence rate, which makes it easier to detect.

3. You sample 300 deer from a high-fenced facility that has a herd of 300. None of the 4000 deer have antibodies against Epizootic Hemorrhagic Disease. Based on this finding, you are 95% confident that the prevalence of exposure to EHD in this facility is>1% because they sampled the right amount, using the table with 95% confidence, the disease should be less than 1% prevalent

TICK LAB 

Ticks are essential to study and understand due to the various diseases they carry and can transmit to humans. Ticks can latch onto reservoir hosts that carry the disease and then transmit it to other hosts, which can be fatal or severe. It is essential to investigate how the spread of tick-borne diseases is evolving.

WORKSHEET 5

The first person to become infected in the current Marburg virus outbreak in Rwanda likely contracted the disease during a visit to a cave with Egyptian rousette bats/fruit bats that are known to harbor the Marburg virus. As of 19 December 2024, 66 cases of Marburg virus infection were documented, and most of the people infected were healthcare workers, mainly those who worked in intensive care units.

1. Spillover vs. EID classification
	This Marburg virus outbreak is best classified as a spillover event. The reservoir is the Egyptian rousette bat, and initial human cases likely resulted from exposure in a bat-inhabited cave. Most subsequent infections occurred among healthcare workers caring for infected patients. Because the virus originates in wildlife and jumps into humans rather than circulating persistently within the human population, it meets the definition of spillover.

2. Measures to reduce transmission
	Healthcare settings: patient isolation, PPE use, strict hygiene and sanitation protocols, screening, and quarantining exposed workers.
	Community settings: avoiding bat-inhabited caves, improving public awareness, reducing wildlife contact, and maintaining strong surveillance.

WORKSHEET 7

Nipah Virus
Nipah virus ecology varies by region, influencing how the virus spreads and how prevention is targeted.
	-Malaysia: Transmission occurs primarily from bats → pigs → humans. Pigs act as bridge hosts. Prevention focuses on monitoring pig populations, controlling pig–bat interactions, and preventing contact with contaminated fruit.
	-Bangladesh: Transmission is seasonal and tied to contamination of raw date palm sap by bats. Prevention emphasizes sap protection (e.g., sap pot covers), hygiene, and community education.
	-India: Transmission occurs from bats → humans and between humans. Prevention includes mask use, distancing, sanitation, and early case detection.
	-Philippines: Bat → human transmission is primary. Prevention involves reducing human–bat interactions and using protective equipment when exposure is unavoidable.

Avian Reovirus
	ARV can be transmitted:
		Vertically: from hen to egg
		Horizontally: fecal–oral route, contaminated litter, equipment, or feed
	Environmental factors such as poor ventilation, humidity, contaminated litter, and overcrowding increase environmental persistence and transmission.
	Pathogen characteristics that support transmission include environmental resistance and the ability to survive for weeks in contaminated settings.
	Example disease: Avian reoviruses cause viral arthritis/tenosynovitis in birds, reducing mobility, growth, and survival. Avian reoviruses (ARV) can be transmitted through multiple routes.

Langya henipavirus
	Likely reservoir: shrews
	Transmission route: spillover from infected shrews to humans through direct or indirect contact.
LayV is a spillover event, not an emerging infectious disease, because it does not transmit between humans. Each infection represents an independent spillover, and humans serve as dead-end hosts.

WORKSHEET 8

Overall prevalence: 47.2% (CI: 37.4–57.1). Nearly half the sampled raccoons carried at least one roundworm.
Regional patterns:
	North: 28.6% (0.171–0.425)
	South: 62.8% (0.466–0.764)
	Central: 64.3% (0.346–0.868)
Differences among regions were statistically significant (p = 0.00178). Warmer climates likely support higher parasite survival, contributing to higher prevalence in southern and central areas. Given that environments play an important role in pathogen virulence and prevalence, the lower numbers in the northern regions compared to the south or central regions could indicate an environmental issue. Further, this suggests that raccoons exhibit different behavioral or habitat traits that account for differences between regions. Looking further into the data, central numbers could be affected by the small sample size, which could also coincide with the large confidence interval.
 Females have nearly double the prevalence of these roundworms than males do. Raccoons may show different behavioral and lifestyle patterns by gender, which could account for the differences in these numbers.    

Age patterns
	Young: 28% (0.169–0.422)
	Adults: 64.3% (0.509–0.763)
Although adults show higher prevalence, age differences were not statistically significant (p = 0.228). Region and sex appear to be stronger drivers.

Sex patterns
	Males: 38% (0.272–0.496)
	Females: 65% (0.498–0.780)
Sex differences were statistically significant (p = 0.0136). Female raccoons consistently had higher prevalence, potentially due to behavioral or physiological factors.

Regional × sex interactions
Clear patterns emerged:
	-Southern and central females showed extremely high prevalence (approaching 100%), with smaller sample sizes influencing CI width.
	-Northern populations showed lower and more similar prevalence across sexes, reinforcing environmental influences.
	CENTRAL 
		Male prevalence: 44.4% (0.137- 0.788)
		Female: 100% (0.478 -0.100)
	SOUTH
		Male: 50.0% (0.319 - 0.681)
		Female: 100% (0.715 - 0.100)
	NORTH
		Male: 21.4% (0.083 - 0.409)
		Female: 38.1% (0.181 - 0.616)

Regional x age interactions
	CENTRAL
		Young: 100% (0.207-1.00), (sample size of 1) 
		Adults: 61.5% (0.355-0.823)
	SOUTH
		Young: 50% (0.254-0.746) 
		Adult prevalence: 67.7% (0.501-0.814)
	NORTH:
		Young: 29.2% (0.149 - 0.492)
		Adults: 28% (0.143 - 0.476)

Interpretation
Regional climate and environmental conditions appear to be the primary drivers of roundworm prevalence. Sex-based differences were also substantial. These findings point to targeted management in warmer regions and to further research into sex-based susceptibility. North is the outlier with much lower prevalence, so further research into eradicating roundworm infections could focus on warmer climates and on what exactly is causing higher prevalence in those areas. The same could be said for females, researching differences between males and females and looking into which differences could be the cause for higher prevalence and how. Education could be focused on individuals in warmer climates who are at higher risk of infection to limit spillover and further spread. Humans could also pose a risk of spreading these parasites in warmer climates due to increased activity and greater exposure opportunities. Since female infections are more prevalent in each region, their populations could be targeted more for testing and treatment, but this is a challenge because the populations are wild rather than domesticated.

WORKSHEET 9

1. In 2024, a multistate Salmonella outbreak was linked to backyard poultry flocks in the United States. What specific human behaviors contributed to the zoonotic spread of Salmonella? In your response, identify at least three practices by backyard poultry owners that increased the risk of Salmonella transmission, and briefly explain why these behaviors facilitated human infection.

Humans can exacerbate the conditions that allow diseases to thrive and multiply. Humans disturb the ecosystems where birds live by urbanizing and taking their habitats. Removing habitats from birds can lead to denser bird populations, where Salmonella can spread quickly and easily in their populations. Infected birds' droplets are the main way Salmonella spreads, so putting these birds in an environment where contamination is likely much higher, due to less space to spread out, will lead to the disease spreading at a higher rate. Urbanization as a whole increases interactions and contamination between animals and humans, leading to more infections. 

1. Backyard poultry owners often exhibit poor hygiene practices, such as not washing hands or having proper hygiene after contact with sources of contamination. Salmonella can persist on surfaces for extended periods if proper hygiene is not practiced, facilitating its transfer to other surfaces and the spread of contamination. Through indirect contact, the Salmonella pathogen can spread. After handling or collecting eggs from the coops, some farmers may not wash their hands or properly wash the eggs, which can be a source of transmission to humans. There is no regulation on proper channels or cleansing when eggs or poultry are coming straight from the backyard or being sold to the community. This route causes the Salmonella to stay on the hands or even contaminate the food, eggs, and is ingested by humans or transferred. 

2. Many families have chickens, and the kids get too close to them, which makes it easy for the pathogen to be transmitted. Backyard poultry farms allow for direct, close contamination. The risk of direct transmission is much higher because these animals are treated more like pets and are in closer contact with people. In rare cases, pets like dogs and cats can get into the feeders and spread this bacteria to the humans inside the home. The problem is that these birds might look healthy, and the kids will be kissing or petting them, while really the bird has Salmonella all over it, and now the kid has direct contact with the bacteria, which could lead to further spread within the family. 

3. Salmonella can be tracked from farm to farm, traveling on shoes or clothing that have come into contact with infected poultry or contaminated sites. This leads to environmental contact and further transfer. Many will come into the house wearing the same shoes as they did in the coop, allowing for easy transmission to places in the home. This causes cross-contamination. Salmonella is very persistent in the environment where poultry lives, so proper hygiene after leaving a coop is essential to prevent further spread to multiple platforms and spaces. Many backyard flocks do not regularly get tested, so culling is less prevalent, and Salmonella can spread to other flocks and throughout the backyard through product contamination or direct contact. Humans can also act as bridge hosts, especially when they are in such close contact with poultry, as backyard poultry farmers are. Humans can carry Salmonella on clothing, hands, shoes, and equipment that have not been properly washed, especially if they are not practicing proper hygiene. In rare cases, pets like dogs and cats can get into the feeders and spread this bacteria to the humans inside the home. 

Many humans are also unaware of the threat bird feeders pose to Salmonella. People who are changing out bird feeders or pets with access to them are exposed to sites where many wild birds have cross-contaminated, which could make it a hotspot for salmonella. Hand hygiene is essential for limiting human contamination of Salmonella. Overall, the public's lack of education and hygiene regarding this topic and ways of contamination leads to further human infections. Backyard poultry owners traveling to other animal environments further spread infection to these animals and could serve as a bridge to other humans. CDC and health officials are trying to educate the public on basic practices such as proper hygiene, not moving items from the coop to other locations, and improving the transfer of germs from the coop to inside the home, especially by kids, but many people are not aware of how this spreads or do not take the time to self regulate when it comes to small backyard flocks.

2. Tall fescue grass is commonly infected with a fungal endophyte (Epichloë
coenophiala) that produces ergot alkaloids associated with fescue toxicosis in
grazing livestock.
	a. What advantage does Tall fescue gain from being infected with a fungal
       endophyte? 
		-The grass can grow in conditions where it could not previously grow without the fungal endophyte. It allows the grass to thrive by producing alkaloids that make it more tolerant of its environment, including drought, insects, and poor soil. This allows the grass species to dominate other species around it and persist in many environments. The grass is durable, drought-resistant, easy to establish, regrows quickly, and is suitable for grazing by big herds. This makes the grass tolerant to weather changes. Their relationship is mutualistic; the endophyte enhances root growth and depth, makes them more tolerant to various conditions, and overall makes the plant more durable, which gives a competitive advantage.   

	b. What environmental and ecological factors drive the occurrence and severity of
       Fescue toxicosis in grazing systems? 
		-The climate and environment affect the prevalence of this toxicosis; high temperatures and drought stress increase alkoid production. Drought causes fewer nutrients in the soil, so alkaloids are produced to be protective. Soil fertility and microbial communities affect endophyte expression. Overgrazing affects toxin accumulation and disease risk. The cows eat the part of the plant that is most dense with the toxicity because of the over-grazing. If the grass type is dominant in the pasture, this also does not allow for grazing systems to eat anything other than this grass. Soil fertility and moisture levels can also increase the toxin levels, especially if conditions make it easier for the grass to overdominate the pasture. Soil makeup can also feed toxic alkaloids, depending on whether the soil is rich in nitrogen or other components the alkaloids feed on. The soil microbiome shows a correlation with the severity of toxicosis. The toxicity impairs cattle's ability to regulate their temperature, and warmer conditions exacerbate this, while alkoid concentrations are higher in the grass in warmer environments. The toxicity impairs the cattle's heat regulation, and therefore, in warmer weather, the cattle are already struggling to dissipate heat, but now the toxicosis makes this even more difficult. Climate conditions (heat, drought, season change) can lead to plant changes (nutrient stress, no moisture) which can lead to more endophytes produced in the grass which can lead to alkoloid concentrations increasing which leads to more cattle eating the toxicity and then you can see livestock outcome conditions exasterbated by the climate as well; it is all a chain of events.

	c. What are the key clinical signs of fescue toxicity in cattle? 
		-Cattle look malnourished and experience weight loss, rough and discolored hair coats, along with poor performance. Clincal signs can present as fever, lethargy, swelling, and coat abnormalities. As the temperature rises, the cattle have more problems trying to dissipate heat and may show signs such as seeking shade or excessive water intake. Metabolism is affected, resulting in weight loss. Cows present as eating less because their metabolism is affected and not functioning normally. Lipid and carbohydrate metabolism are reduced, which will affect eating patterns. Immune function is also affected, and cows are at higher risk of contracting illnesses that could be fatal.

WORKSHEET 10

1. What are the different routes of transmission for African Swine fever? What role do
humans play in the spread and transmission of ASF? 

-African Swine fever can be transmitted through vectors (tick bites); these ticks persist for long periods of time, making ASF very hard to eradicate. Secondly, it can be transmitted through direct contact with an infected pig through blood, saliva, or feces, and through indirect contact by contaminated sources such as feed, trucks transporting infected feed or pigs, or on equipment or clothing. Swill feeding is a risk because much of the feed can be contaminated with pork products that can easily infect the whole pig population. Many farmers use this feeding process, which contributes to the spread of ASF because of the heightened risk. Also, through environmental persistence, ASF survives for months on carcasses and various pork products, allowing for easier transmission when humans are transporting pork products and pigs across borders. Pork products are transported to many locations far apart, allowing the virus to spread widely. There is also an illegal trade of pork products that can be very dangerous for humans handling or consuming the products, and easily transfers to other pig populations. Humans can act as mechanical vectors by traveling to and from farms and moving the ASF with them, infecting countless pig populations. Many farms also do not detect the disease until it is too late, and it spreads to other pigs or farms. The financial struggles and testing for this disease are overlooked. The detection of ASF can cause large economic loss, so the struggle there is not wanting to test because it can only result in loss of money for many farmers if positive. Humans play a role by transferring infected meat, like in the illegal pork trade. Humans also serve as vectors, transmitting the infection from farm to farm through clothing, vehicles, or equipment. Humans do not themselves become infected, but they serve as bridge hosts for multiple animal populations. Biosecurity is a huge challenge when looking at the human role in the spread of this virus due to the mass transport and traveling humans are involved in in the farm and pig industry 

2. Describe how co-infection with Koala retrovirus (KoRV) affects the severity,
progression, and management of Chlamydia in koalas.

KoRV infection causes immunity suppression and is correlated with a higher prevalence of chlamydia infections. When immunity is suppressed by this virus, it is easier for chlamydia to infect the koala because there is less immune defense. The virus brings down the immunity of koalas and can make chlamydia more severe when contracted by a koala, leading to higher mortality rates. When koalas contract KoRV, symptoms are worse with chlamydia, and the bacterial load is greater. It causes greater overall disease severity and prevalence because koalas are more susceptible when they are also infected with KoRV. The body is not able to fight off the disease because of immunosuppression, which allows chlamydia to have rapid progression. This makes it harder to treat due to the wild population and immunosuppression caused by KoRV. This also leads to lower fertility rates and reduced reproduction, affecting the overall population and the environment around them. Coinfection of KoRV and chlamydia leads to more bacteria in the animal, which would need more antibiotic treatments, and this is not good for the koalas because it kills the good bacteria in their gut that they need to break down their food source. The immune system is fighting off two viruses, so the symptoms of chlamydia are worsened, and the koala can experience worse vision loss, wet bottom, and other complications with treatments and relapses of the virus.

3. Snake Fungal Disease (SFD), caused by Ophidiomyces ophiodiicola, is an emerging threat to wild snake populations in North America.
What are the key challenges associated with the surveillance and management of Snake Fungal Disease? 

-SFD is usually asymptomatic within the first month or two, so it spreads before it can be diagnosed; this makes it especially difficult during brumation because the snakes are dormant and the disease can spread without being noticed at all. Fungal spores are also very persistent and can persist in moist soil for long periods, potentially infecting multiple snakes. Snakes are often less closely monitored than other species, and diseases can go undetected and spread more easily across the species. Outbreaks are hard to stop because the prevalence of the disease is noticed too late and has already spread among the snakes. Due to the lack of research, scientists are still not certain about the dynamics behind transmission, so it is hard to stop the spread because the exact modes of transmission are not fully understood. There is also not much research on this species or the disease in particular. Many of the tests yield false negatives and are not very reliable, so it is a tough disease to contain and treat actual positive snakes. Overall, there is really not enough funding that goes into studying or caring for these snakes, so SFD becomes very hard to understand and therefore manage, and has inadequate surveillance. The treatments that are available are only somewhat practical even for domestic snakes, so there are no practical treatments or medications that wild snakes can receive. No treatment is easy to mass distribute to wild snake populations because it is a hands-on procedure to help with the symptoms. The treatments require repetitive cleansing and treating, so for a wild snake, this is not practical at all.

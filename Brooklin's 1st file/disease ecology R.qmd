![](EpiTriad.png)
This image of the EpiTriad shows how three things affect the overall prevalence, transmission, and livelihood of diseases. The environment, host, and pathogen must all come together in a way for a disease to thrive. With certain conditions on each level, the disease can change. 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  	
	1. Find the sample size necessary to detect a disease at or above 5% prevalence in a herd of 5000 deer. The desired level of confidence is 95%
			59
	
	2. Using the hypergeometric distribution, compare the sample size requirements for the following scenarios:
	a. 95% confidence in detecting a disease at 1% prevalence in a large population
		299
	b.99% confidence in detecting a disease at 2% prevalence in a large population 
		229
Both are close to the same number because even though the confidence level goes up, less animals are needed for sampling. You are looking for a higher prevalence rate, so it is easier to detect.

3. You sample 300 deer from a high-fenced facility that has a herd of 300. None of the 4000 deer have antibodies against Epizootic Hemorrhagic Disease. Based on this finding, you are 95% confident that the prevalence of exposure to EHD in this facility is	
>1% because they sampled the right amount, using the table with 95% confidence, the disease should be less than 1% prevalent
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
a) Find incidence on day 06/12/25, 06/14/25 and 06/15/25. Write the unit for incidence.
(9 points)   
	6/12-  0.0980 cases per elk day
					work- 56-5= 51 new cases-5      5/51=0.098
	6/14- 0.043478 cases per elk day 
					work-56-10=46  new cases- 2     2/46=0.0434
	6/15-  0 cases per elk day 
					work-56-12=44   new cases- 0     2/44=0.0

b) What is the prevalence of conjunctivitis on 06/13/25 and 06/16/25? What is the unit
for prevalence. (5 points)
	6/13- 21.429% prevalence of disease symptoms 
				work- 12/56
	6/16- 8.929% prevalence of disease symptoms 
				work- 5/56
	

c) On which day is the prevalence same as the incidence (except the units)? (3 points)
		on 6/10- prevalence=1.79% incidence=0.179 cases per elk day, because no preexisting cases 																				before this day

d) On which day is the incidence lowest? (3 points)
		On 6/15 and 6/16, there are no new cases, and therefore, the incidence is 0 on both days

Ticks are essential to study and understand due to the various diseases they carry and can transmit to humans. Ticks can latch onto reservoir hosts that are carrying the disease and then transmit it to other hosts, which can be fatal or severe for these hosts. It is essential to investigate how the spread of tick-borne diseases is evolving.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. 
a. False, microparasites do have shorter lives, but they DO reproduce within the host 
d. TRUE,
	The severity of mortality and disease has many determining factors, such as susceptibility, environment, and pathogen characteristics. Therefore, it is not always the case that we see the exact same outbreak characteristics each time; however, it does cause high mortality in white-tailed deer.
f. False, HPS is environmentally transmitted by the human inhaling the aerosolized droppings of an infected rodent 

4. 
c. Calculate beta for measles and Rotavirus
	measles 15/8- 1.875    Rotavirus= 17/14days - 1.21
d. calculate Reff for measles with 80% vax 
			R0(1-0.8)
			1.875(0.2)- 0.375
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. False, MERS-CoV is mostly found in camels and only in human populations with direct physical contact. 
2. TRUE
3. False, some human-human transmission can occur, and while it is not the main transmission, it is not a dead-end because sometimes the illness does transmit to other humans with contact
4. False, the paragraph states 35% of the cases have died, which would be the case fatality rate. 
5. False, this curve shows more of a propagated curve and how the disease is transmitted from human to human. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The first person to become infected in the current Marburg virus outbreak in Rwanda
probably contracted the disease during a visit to a cave with Egyptian rousette bats/fruit
bats that are known reservoir of Marburg virus. As of 19 December 2024, 66 cases of
Marburg virus infection were documented, and most of the people infected were health
care workers, mainly those who worked in intensive care units.
	1. Using the community epidemiology framework developed by Fenton and Pedersen,
	would you classify this Marburg virus outbreak as a spillover event or an emerging
	infectious disease? Justify your classification. 5 points
Spillover because the main reservoir is bats not humans. Most of the cases were probably infected becuase they work in the ICU.
At the start, it was a normal disease in bats that accidentally spilled over to humans, which is, by definition, spillover. 

	2. What measures could be implemented to reduce the risk of transmission in both
	community and healthcare settings? 5 points
Given that the disease is contagious, especially in the healthcare setting, hospitals can isolate patients and require staff to wear protective gear when working with them and to take extra precautions when an individual has the disease or is dealing with someone who has it. Community-wise, staying away from caves known to have bats, or even wearing protective gear, could help prevent further spillover events.

Nipah Virus
Nipah virus ecology varies across regions, resulting in distinct patterns of transmission
in places like Malaysia and Bangladesh. Describe how the modes of transmission differ
between these two regions and explain how these differences influence the preventive
measures recommended in each setting. 

-In Malaysia, the fatality rate is lower, and bridge hosts are shown to transmit the virus. The bat that has the disease passes it to a pig when the pig eats infected food, and then the pig passes it to humans. Monitoring these pig species that serve as bridge hosts could help determine when the virus spreads and whether people should avoid pigs at certain times. Avoiding fruit that looks like a pig or a bridge host has eaten it also helps contain the spread. 

-In Bangladesh, the transmission is seen seasonally. The bats get into the honey being harvested and defecate or urinate, which contaminates the honey with the virus, and when humans consume it, they get the virus. Preventative measures here can look like, and have looked like, lids being added to the honey pots so the bee cannot get into the honey and spread the disease. 

-In India, the pathway is from the bats to the humans and from human to human transmission. Human-to-human transmission can be prevented through measures such as those we saw during COVID: people can wear masks, social distance, and take proper sanitary measures. Human screening can be helpful in containing the spread and quarantining infected individuals. 

-In the Philippines, the pathway is from the bats to the humans. Decreasing the interactions between bats and humans and wearing protective equipment when humans must interact with bats are preventive measures being taken. Protecting the habitats of these bats would help decrease many routes of transmission, but it is one way that could help this specific path. 

Avian Reovirus
Avian reoviruses (ARV) can be transmitted through multiple routes. Describe the
different transmission routes of ARV and explain which environmental factors favor its
transmission. What pathogen characteristics support one of these transmission routes?
Finally, provide an example of a wild bird disease caused by ARV and briefly describe
its impact on the affected population.

-There is both vertical and horizontal transmission, the fecal-oral route, and the route through egg transmission. Poor litter hygiene, overcrowding, and inadequate ventilation can contribute to the spread of this virus. If the environment a litter is staying in is unsanitary and germs fester, the virus can survive for weeks and continue to spread. If the feed is contaminated, the whole litter can easily get infected. Humidity and temperature are also factors that help the virus persist and continue to spread. The pathogen is highly resistant and can survive for weeks waiting to be transmitted to other hosts or spread to other flocks. The ARV causes Avian Influenza in birds and is fatal in some cases. This is also important because, in some instances, it can transmit to humans, and some even think it will be the next outbreak humans face. 


Langya henipavirus
Langya henipavirus (LayV) is an emerging zoonotic virus first identified in China.
Describe the likely reservoir and transmission route of Langya virus. Why is LayV
classified as a spillover and not a potential EID? 

-The most common reservoir is shrews, which spread the virus through invading crops and to humans, most likely through indirect or direct contact with infected animals. Many farmers and rural workers show the highest spillover events due to working in the areas infected by these shrews. 

-There is no human-to-human transmission. It is just repeated spillover events to an individual multiple times. Each human infection is independent. Humans are accidental dead-end hosts.

WORKSHEET 8

Overall, the prevalence of roundworms across all raccoon populations in this data was 47.2% (37.4-57.1); this is the prevalence of at least one worm per raccoon, so almost half of the population has been infected at some level. Females have nearly double the prevalence of these roundworms that males have. Raccoons may show different patterns by gender, which could account for the differences in these numbers. North regions show a 28.6% prevalence (0.171- 0.425), south regions show a 62.8% prevalence (0.466 – 0.764), and central regions show a 64.3% prevalence (34.6- 0.0868). Prevalence differs strongly among regions. When looking for a statistically significant difference between regions, the p-value is 0.00178. This p-value is less than 0.05, indicating a significant difference in the prevalence of roundworms across regions. Central vs South regions do not show a statistically significant difference, but when compared to northern populations, there is a statistically significant difference. These numbers are telling, given that environments play an important role in pathogen virulence and prevalence, so the northern numbers being much lower than those in the southern or central regions could indicate an environmental issue. In cold environments, roundworms could have lower survival rates, while they thrive in warmer climates, which would account for these numbers. Further, this suggests that raccoons exhibit different behavioral or habitat traits that account for differences between regions. Looking further into the data, central numbers could be affected by the small sample size, which could also coincide with the large confidence interval. 

Young raccoons show 28% prevalence (0.169-0.422), while older adults show a higher prevalence of 64.3% (0.509-0.763), and this may be due to exposure to certain factors, differences in immunology, or other factors that young raccoons do not experience compared to adults. However, the p-value was 0.228, no statistical difference between ages, which could be accounted for when adjusting for different regions and sexes. Adults are likely to have a higher prevalence because they have had more time to be exposed to the worms.

In Northern regions, young show a 29.2% prevalence (0.149-0.492) and adults show a 28% prevalence (0.143-0.476). There is no evidence of an age difference here. In southern regions, the young prevalence is 50% (0.254-0.746) and the adult prevalence is 67.7% (0.501-0.814). This evidence shows a higher prevalence and a significant difference between the adult and young raccoon populations. In the central region, the young prevalence is 100% (0.207-1.00), but this could be affected by the sample size of 1, which explains the substantial range in the confidence interval. Adult prevalence in the central region is 61.5% (0.355-0.823). While the young prevalence number is obviously higher, the confidence intervals suggest that adult prevalence is higher with a larger sample for this region. 

Overall, when looking at males vs females, the males have a 38% prevalence (0.272-0.496) and females have a 65% prevalence (0.498 – 0.780).
When comparing sex differences, the p-value was 0.0136, suggesting a statistically significant difference in the prevalence of roundworms between sexes. Sex has a considerable effect on the prevalence of roundworms. Females have also been shown to have a higher average worm count than males. This could suggest that females are a preferred host for the worms to multiply, possibly because of their biology or differences in behavioral and feeding patterns. 

Central region males versus central region females was also a shocking difference. Males in this region had a prevalence of 44.4% (13.7%-78.8%), while the females had a prevalence of 100% (47.8%-100%). Females seem to have almost a sure chance of getting this disease, or at least a much higher rate than males do. Southern regions also demonstrated these rates, with males having a 50.0% prevalence (31.9%-68.1%) and females having a 100% prevalence (71.5%-100%). Noting that the confidence interval is much narrower in the southern regions than in the central regions could be due to the smaller sample size in the central regions. In contrast, northern regions had a male prevalence of 21.4% (8.3%-40.9%), lower than that in southern and central regions, and only 38.1% prevalence (18.1%-61.6%) in females; while the females still have a higher percentage, it is not drastic, and further backs up the theory of how the environment influences how the pathogen works. In all regions, however, females still experience a higher prevalence, and in southern and central regions this is particularly pronounced, which could correlate with factors such as birthing patterns, hibernation, interactions with adolescents, or other behavioral and biological influences that separate females from males. 

It is interesting to notice that the north is the outlier in multiple points of this data set. When comparing adults to young, the prevalence is almost identical, in contrast to warmer regions. Also, females have a slightly higher prevalence, but it is not statistically significant. It would be interesting to research further whether females exhibit different behavioral or eating patterns in these climates that could account for the lower prevalence, or whether it is simply due to environmental factors affecting the pathogen and overall rates. The central and southern regions show a 100% prevalence for females, with some room for adjustment in the confidence intervals, but almost double the percentages for the male prevalence. In contrast, the northern females are not too much higher in prevalence than the males, suggesting the environmental factors are more impactful than sex or age.

Worksheet 9
1. In 2024, a multistate Salmonella outbreak was linked to backyard poultry flocks in
the United States. What specific human behaviors contributed to the zoonotic
spread of Salmonella? In your response, identify at least three practices by backyard
poultry owners that increased the risk of Salmonella transmission, and briefly explain
why these behaviors facilitated human infection.
	- not washing hands or having proper hygiene after contact with sources of contamination. Salmonella can remain on surfaces for extended periods if proper hygiene is not practiced, leading to its transfer to other surfaces and the spread of contamination. Many families have chickens, and the kids get too close to them, which makes it easy for the pathogen to be transmitted. Salmonella can be tracked from farm to farm, traveling on shoes or clothing that have come into contact with infected poultry or contaminated sites. This causes cross-contamination. 
Salmonella is very persistent in the environment where poultry lives, so proper hygiene after leaving a coop is essential to prevent further spread to multiple platforms and spaces. Adequate education has been publicized, and CDC and health officials are trying to educate the public on basic practices such as proper hygiene, not moving items from the coop to other locations, and improving the transfer of germs from the coop to inside the home, especially by kids. Children and elderly are vulnerable populations for this illness (33%< 1YR OLD). 
product contamination and culling 
environmental contamination- feeders and water 
spillover- direct and indirect contact with shared resources -bridge hosts 

CLEAN FEEDERS- BIRDFEEDERS IN BACKYARD- 73% LINKED TO THIS WILD BIRD EXPOSURE - PET ACESS TO FEEDERS - HAND HYGIENE AFTER DOING FEEDERS

URBANIZATION- INCREASES HUMAN AND WILD BIRD INTERACTION 

2. Tall fescue grass is commonly infected with a fungal endophyte (Epichloë
coenophiala) that produces ergot alkaloids associated with fescue toxicosis in
grazing livestock.
	a. What advantage does Tall fescue gain from being infected with a fungal
       endophyte? 
		-The grass can grow in conditions where it could not previously grow without the fungal endophyte. It allows the grass to thrive by producing alkaloids that make it more tolerant of its environment, including drought, insects, and poor soil. This allows the grass species to dominate other species around it and persist in many environments. The grass is durable, drought resistant, easy to establish, regrows quicly, and good for grazing by big herds. This makes the grass tolerant to weather changes

	b. What environmental and ecological factors drive the occurrence and severity of
       Fescue toxicosis in grazing systems? 
		-The climate and environment affects the virulence of this toxicosis; temperature and drought stress increase alkoid production. Soil fertility and microbial commuinities affect endophyte expression. Grazing mangment affects toxin accumulation and risk of disease. Climate, soil nutrients, and grazing influence toxin levels. soil fertility and mositure level can also increase levels of the toxin, especially if the conditions make it easier for the grass to overdominate the pasture. Soil microbiome shows strong corelation with the severity of the toxicosis. 

	c. What are the key clinical signs of fescue toxicity in cattle? 
		-Cattle looks malnourished and experience weight loss, rough and discolored hair coats along with poor performance. Temperature also            presents as higher while the core temperture is lowered, metabolism is affected portraying in weight loss. Cows present as eating less becasue the metabolism is affected and not functioning as normal. lipid and carbohydrate metabolism is lowered and this will affect eating patterns. Immune function is also affected and cows are at higher risk of contracting illnesses which could be fatal.

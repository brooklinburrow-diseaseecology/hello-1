![](EpiTriad.png)
The Epidemiologic Triad illustrates how the interactions among the host, pathogen, and environment shape disease outcomes. Disease emergence, prevalence, and transmission depend on these three components aligning in ways that support pathogen survival and spread. Changes in any one of these factors can alter disease dynamics.

WORKSHEET 2

1. Find the sample size necessary to detect a disease at or above 5% prevalence in a herd of 5000 deer @95% CONFIDENCE
			59

2. Using the hypergeometric distribution, compare the sample size requirements for the following scenarios:
	a. 95% confidence in detecting a disease at 1% prevalence in a large population: 299
	b.99% confidence in detecting a disease at 2% prevalence in a large population: 229
	Both are close to the same number because, even as the confidence level increases, fewer animals are needed for sampling. You are looking for a higher prevalence rate, which makes it easier to detect.

3. You sample 300 deer from a high-fenced facility that has a herd of 300. None of the 4000 deer have antibodies against Epizootic Hemorrhagic Disease. Based on this finding, you are 95% confident that the prevalence of exposure to EHD in this facility iS >1% because they sampled the right amount, using the table with 95% confidence, the disease should be less than 1% prevalent

TICK LAB 

Ticks are essential to study and understand due to the various diseases they carry and can transmit to humans. Ticks can latch onto reservoir hosts that are carrying the disease and then transmit it to other hosts, which can be fatal or severe for these hosts. It is essential to investigate how the spread of tick-borne diseases is evolving.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TEST CORRECTIONS

a. False, microparasites do have shorter lives, but they DO reproduce within the host 
d. TRUE,
	The severity of mortality and disease has many determining factors, such as susceptibility, environment, and pathogen characteristics. Therefore, it is not always the case that we see the exact same outbreak characteristics each time; however, it does cause high mortality in white-tailed deer.
f. False, HPS is environmentally transmitted by the human inhaling the aerosolized droppings of an infected rodent

WORKSHEET 4

1. False, MERS-CoV is mostly found in camels and only in human populations with direct physical contact. 
2. TRUE
3. False, some human-human transmission can occur, and while it is not the main transmission, it is not a dead-end because sometimes the illness does transmit to other humans with contact
4. False, the paragraph states 35% of the cases have died, which would be the case fatality rate. 
5. False, this curve shows more of a propagated curve and how the disease is transmitted from human to human.

WORKSHEET 5

The first person to become infected in the current Marburg virus outbreak in Rwanda
probably contracted the disease during a visit to a cave with Egyptian rousette bats/fruit
bats that are known to be a reservoir of the Marburg virus. As of 19 December 2024, 66 cases of
Marburg virus infection was documented, and most of the people infected were healthy
care workers, mainly those who worked in intensive care units.

1. Using the community epidemiology framework developed by Fenton and Pedersen,
would you classify this Marburg virus outbreak as a spillover event or an emerging
infectious disease? Justify your classification. 5 points
	-Spillover because the main reservoir is bats, not humans. Most of the cases were probably infected because they work in the ICU.
	At the start, it was a normal disease in bats that accidentally spilled over to humans, which is, by definition, spillover. 

2. What measures could be implemented to reduce the risk of transmission in both
community and healthcare settings? 5 points
	-Given that the disease is contagious, especially in the healthcare setting, hospitals can isolate patients and require staff to wear 			protective gear when working with them and to take extra precautions when an individual has the disease or is dealing with someone who has 		it. Community-wise, staying away from caves known to have bats, or even wearing protective gear, could help prevent further spillover 			events.

WORKSHEET 7

Nipah Virus
Nipah virus ecology varies across regions, resulting in distinct patterns of transmission
in places like Malaysia and Bangladesh. Describe how the modes of transmission differ
between these two regions and explain how these differences influence the preventive
measures recommended in each setting. 

-In Malaysia, the fatality rate is lower, and bridge hosts are shown to transmit the virus. The bat that has the disease passes it to a pig when the pig eats infected food, and then the pig passes it to humans. Monitoring these pig species that serve as bridge hosts could help determine when the virus spreads and whether people should avoid pigs at certain times. Avoiding fruit that looks like a pig or a bridge host has eaten it also helps contain the spread. 

-In Bangladesh, the transmission is seen seasonally. The bats get into the honey being harvested and defecate or urinate, which contaminates the honey with the virus, and when humans consume it, they get the virus. Preventative measures here can look like, and have looked like, lids being added to the honey pots so the bee cannot get into the honey and spread the disease. 

-In India, the pathway is from the bats to the humans and from human to human transmission. Human-to-human transmission can be prevented through measures such as those we saw during COVID: people can wear masks, social distance, and take proper sanitary measures. Human screening can be helpful in containing the spread and quarantining infected individuals. 

-In the Philippines, the pathway is from the bats to the humans. Decreasing the interactions between bats and humans and wearing protective equipment when humans must interact with bats are preventive measures being taken. Protecting the habitats of these bats would help decrease many routes of transmission, but it is one way that could help this specific path. 

Avian Reovirus
Avian reoviruses (ARV) can be transmitted through multiple routes. Describe the
different transmission routes of ARV and explain which environmental factors favor its
transmission. What pathogen characteristics support one of these transmission routes?
Finally, provide an example of a wild bird disease caused by ARV and briefly describe
its impact on the affected population.

-There is both vertical and horizontal transmission, the fecal-oral route, and the route through egg transmission. Poor litter hygiene, overcrowding, and inadequate ventilation can contribute to the spread of this virus. If the environment a litter is staying in is unsanitary and germs fester, the virus can survive for weeks and continue to spread. If the feed is contaminated, the whole litter can easily get infected. Humidity and temperature are also factors that help the virus persist and continue to spread. The pathogen is highly resistant and can survive for weeks waiting to be transmitted to other hosts or spread to other flocks. The ARV causes Avian Influenza in birds and is fatal in some cases. This is also important because, in some instances, it can transmit to humans, and some even think it will be the next outbreak humans face. 


Langya henipavirus
Langya henipavirus (LayV) is an emerging zoonotic virus first identified in China.
Describe the likely reservoir and transmission route of Langya virus. Why is LayV
classified as a spillover and not a potential EID? 

-The most common reservoir is shrews, which spread the virus through invading crops and to humans, most likely through indirect or direct contact with infected animals. Many farmers and rural workers show the highest spillover events due to working in the areas infected by these shrews. 

-There is no human-to-human transmission. It is just repeated spillover events to an individual multiple times. Each human infection is independent. Humans are accidental dead-end hosts.

WORKSHEET 8

Overall, the prevalence of roundworms across all raccoon populations in this data was 47.2% (37.4-57.1); this is the prevalence of at least one worm per raccoon, so almost half of the population has been infected at some level. Females have nearly double the prevalence of these roundworms than males do. Raccoons may show different behavioral and lifestyle patterns by gender, which could account for the differences in these numbers. North regions show a 28.6% prevalence (0.171-0.425, 95% CI), south regions show a 62.8% prevalence (0.466 – 0.764, 95% CI), and central regions show a 64.3% prevalence (34.6- 0.0868, 95% CI) of roundworms. Prevalence differs strongly among regions. When looking for a statistically significant difference between regions, the p-value is 0.00178. This p-value is less than 0.05, indicating a significant difference in the prevalence of roundworms across regions. Central vs South regions do not show a statistically significant difference, but when compared to northern populations, there is a statistically significant difference. These numbers are telling, given that environments play an important role in pathogen virulence and prevalence, so the northern numbers being much lower than those in the southern or central regions could indicate an environmental issue. In cold environments, roundworms could have lower survival rates, while they thrive in warmer climates, which would account for these numbers. Further, this suggests that raccoons exhibit different behavioral or habitat traits that account for differences between regions. Looking further into the data, central numbers could be affected by the small sample size, which could also coincide with the large confidence interval. 

Young raccoons show 28% prevalence (0.169-0.422), while older adults show a higher prevalence of 64.3% (0.509-0.763), and this may be due to exposure to certain factors, differences in immunology, or other factors that young raccoons do not experience compared to adults. However, the p-value was 0.228, no statistical difference between ages, which could be accounted for when adjusting for different regions and sexes. Adults are likely to have a higher prevalence because they have had more time to be exposed to the worms. Overall, region and sex differences account for the greater differences in the prevalence of roundworms between groups, more so than age. 

In Northern regions, young show a 29.2% prevalence (0.149-0.492) and adults show a 28% prevalence (0.143-0.476). There is no evidence of an age impact regarding prevalence here. In southern regions, the prevalence in young populations is 50% (0.254-0.746) and the adult prevalence is 67.7% (0.501-0.814). This evidence shows a higher prevalence and a significant difference between the adult and young raccoon populations. In the central region, the prevalence in young raccoons is 100% (0.207-1.00), but this could be affected by the sample size of 1, which explains the substantial range in the confidence interval. Prevalence in the central region adults is 61.5% (0.355-0.823). While the prevalence of young raccoons is obviously higher, the confidence intervals suggest that adult prevalence would likely be higher with a larger sample for this region. 

Overall, when looking at males vs females, the males have a 38% prevalence (0.272-0.496) and females have a 65% prevalence (0.498 – 0.780).
When comparing sex differences, the p-value was 0.0136, suggesting a statistically significant difference in the prevalence of roundworms between sexes. Sex has a considerable effect on the prevalence of roundworms in raccoon populations. Females have also been shown to have a higher average worm count than males. This could suggest that females are a preferred host for the worms to multiply, possibly because of their biology or differences in behavioral and feeding patterns. 

Central region males versus central region females was also a shocking difference. Males in this region had a prevalence of 44.4% (13.7%-78.8%), while the females had a prevalence of 100% (47.8%-100%). Females seem to have almost a sure chance of getting infected, or at least a much higher rate than males do. Southern regions also demonstrated these rates, with males having a 50.0% prevalence (31.9%-68.1%) and females having a 100% prevalence (71.5%-100%). Noting that the confidence interval is much narrower in the southern regions than in the central regions could be due to the smaller sample size in the central regions. In contrast, northern regions had a male prevalence of 21.4% (8.3%-40.9%), lower than that in southern and central regions, and only 38.1% prevalence (18.1%-61.6%) in females; while the females still have a higher percentage, it is not drastic, and further backs up the theory of how the environment influences how the pathogen works. In all regions, however, females still experience a higher prevalence, and in southern and central regions this is particularly pronounced, which could correlate with factors such as birthing patterns, hibernation, interactions with adolescents, or other behavioral and biological influences that separate females from males. 

It is interesting to notice that the north is the outlier in multiple points of this data set. When comparing adults to young, the prevalence is almost identical, in contrast to warmer regions. Also, females have a slightly higher prevalence, but it is not statistically significant. It would be interesting to research further whether females exhibit different behavioral or eating patterns in these climates that could account for the higher prevalence, or whether it is simply due to environmental factors affecting the pathogen and overall rates. The central and southern regions show a 100% prevalence for females, with some room for adjustment in the confidence intervals, but almost double the percentages for the male prevalence. In contrast, the northern females are not too much higher in prevalence than the males, suggesting the environmental factors are more impactful than sex or age. This could suggest that further research into eradicating roundworm infections could be focused on warmer climates and what exactly is causing higher prevalence in warmer areas. The same could be said for females, researching differences between males and females and looking into which differences could be the cause for higher prevalence and how. Education could be focused on individuals in warmer climates who are at higher risk of infection to limit spillover and further spread. Humans could also pose a risk for spreading these parasites in warmer climates because of increased activity and exposure opportunities. Since females show a greater prevalence in each region, their populations could be focused on more to test and treat, but this is a struggle due to the populations being wild and not domesticated.

WORKSHEET 9

1. In 2024, a multistate Salmonella outbreak was linked to backyard poultry flocks in the United States. What specific human behaviors contributed to the zoonotic spread of Salmonella? In your response, identify at least three practices by backyard poultry owners that increased the risk of Salmonella transmission, and briefly explain why these behaviors facilitated human infection.

Humans can exacerbate the conditions that allow diseases to thrive and multiply. Humans disturb the ecosystems where birds live by urbanizing and taking their habitats. Removing habitats from birds can lead to denser bird populations, where Salmonella can spread quickly and easily in their populations. Infected birds' droplets are the main way Salmonella spreads, so putting these birds in an environment where contamination is likely much higher, due to less space to spread out, will lead to the disease spreading at a higher rate. Urbanization as a whole increases interactions and contamination between animals and humans, leading to more infections. 

1. Backyard poultry owners often exhibit poor hygiene practices, such as not washing hands or having proper hygiene after contact with sources of contamination. Salmonella can persist on surfaces for extended periods if proper hygiene is not practiced, facilitating its transfer to other surfaces and the spread of contamination. Through indirect contact, the Salmonella pathogen can spread. After handling or collecting eggs from the coops, some farmers may not wash their hands or properly wash the eggs, which can be a source of transmission to humans. There is no regulation on proper channels or cleansing when eggs or poultry are coming straight from the backyard or being sold to the community. This route causes the Salmonella to stay on the hands or even contaminate the food, eggs, and is ingested by humans or transferred. 

2. Many families have chickens, and the kids get too close to them, which makes it easy for the pathogen to be transmitted. Backyard poultry farms allow for direct, close contamination. The risk of direct transmission is much higher because these animals are treated more like pets and are in closer contact with people. In rare cases, pets like dogs and cats can get into the feeders and spread this bacteria to the humans inside the home. The problem is that these birds might look healthy, and the kids will be kissing or petting them, while really the bird has Salmonella all over it, and now the kid has direct contact with the bacteria, which could lead to further spread within the family. 

3. Salmonella can be tracked from farm to farm, traveling on shoes or clothing that have come into contact with infected poultry or contaminated sites. This leads to environmental contact and further transfer. Many will come into the house wearing the same shoes as they did in the coop, allowing for easy transmission to places in the home. This causes cross-contamination. Salmonella is very persistent in the environment where poultry lives, so proper hygiene after leaving a coop is essential to prevent further spread to multiple platforms and spaces. Many backyard flocks do not regularly get tested, so culling is less prevalent, and Salmonella can spread to other flocks and throughout the backyard through product contamination or direct contact. Humans can also act as bridge hosts, especially when they are in such close contact with poultry, as backyard poultry farmers are. Humans can carry Salmonella on clothing, hands, shoes, and equipment that have not been properly washed, especially if they are not practicing proper hygiene. In rare cases, pets like dogs and cats can get into the feeders and spread this bacteria to the humans inside the home. 

Many humans are also unaware of the threat bird feeders pose to Salmonella. People who are changing out bird feeders or pets with access to them are exposed to sites where many wild birds have cross-contaminated, which could make it a hotspot for salmonella. Hand hygiene is essential for limiting human contamination of Salmonella. Overall, the public's lack of education and hygiene regarding this topic and ways of contamination leads to further human infections. Backyard poultry owners traveling to other animal environments further spread infection to these animals and could serve as a bridge to other humans. CDC and health officials are trying to educate the public on basic practices such as proper hygiene, not moving items from the coop to other locations, and improving the transfer of germs from the coop to inside the home, especially by kids, but many people are not aware of how this spreads or do not take the time to self regulate when it comes to small backyard flocks.

2. Tall fescue grass is commonly infected with a fungal endophyte (Epichloë
coenophiala) that produces ergot alkaloids associated with fescue toxicosis in
grazing livestock.
	a. What advantage does Tall fescue gain from being infected with a fungal
       endophyte? 
		-The grass can grow in conditions where it could not previously grow without the fungal endophyte. It allows the grass to thrive by producing alkaloids that make it more tolerant of its environment, including drought, insects, and poor soil. This allows the grass species to dominate other species around it and persist in many environments. The grass is durable, drought-resistant, easy to establish, regrows quickly, and is suitable for grazing by big herds. This makes the grass tolerant to weather changes. Their relationship is mutualistic; the endophyte enhances root growth and depth, makes them more tolerant to various conditions, and overall makes the plant more durable, which gives a competitive advantage.   

	b. What environmental and ecological factors drive the occurrence and severity of
       Fescue toxicosis in grazing systems? 
		-The climate and environment affect the prevalence of this toxicosis; high temperatures and drought stress increase alkoid production. Drought causes fewer nutrients in the soil, so alkaloids are produced to be protective. Soil fertility and microbial communities affect endophyte expression. Overgrazing affects toxin accumulation and disease risk. The cows eat the part of the plant that is most dense with the toxicity because of the over-grazing. If the grass type is dominant in the pasture, this also does not allow for grazing systems to eat anything other than this grass. Soil fertility and moisture levels can also increase the toxin levels, especially if conditions make it easier for the grass to overdominate the pasture. Soil makeup can also feed toxic alkaloids, depending on whether the soil is rich in nitrogen or other components the alkaloids feed on. The soil microbiome shows a correlation with the severity of toxicosis. The toxicity impairs cattle's ability to regulate their temperature, and warmer conditions exacerbate this, while alkoid concentrations are higher in the grass in warmer environments. The toxicity impairs the cattle's heat regulation, and therefore, in warmer weather, the cattle are already struggling to dissipate heat, but now the toxicosis makes this even more difficult. Climate conditions (heat, drought, season change) can lead to plant changes (nutrient stress, no moisture) which can lead to more endophytes produced in the grass which can lead to alkoloid concentrations increasing which leads to more cattle eating the toxicity and then you can see livestock outcome conditions exasterbated by the climate as well; it is all a chain of events.

	c. What are the key clinical signs of fescue toxicity in cattle? 
		-Cattle look malnourished and experience weight loss, rough and discolored hair coats, along with poor performance. Clincal signs can present as fever, lethargy, swelling, and coat abnormalities. As the temperature rises, the cattle have more problems trying to dissipate heat and may show signs such as seeking shade or excessive water intake. Metabolism is affected, resulting in weight loss. Cows present as eating less because their metabolism is affected and not functioning normally. Lipid and carbohydrate metabolism are reduced, which will affect eating patterns. Immune function is also affected, and cows are at higher risk of contracting illnesses that could be fatal.

WORKSHEET 10

1. What are the different routes of transmission for African Swine fever? What role do
humans play in the spread and transmission of ASF? 

-African Swine fever can be transmitted through vectors (tick bites); these ticks persist for long periods of time, making ASF very hard to eradicate. Secondly, it can be transmitted through direct contact with an infected pig through blood, saliva, or feces, and through indirect contact by contaminated sources such as feed, trucks transporting infected feed or pigs, or on equipment or clothing. Swill feeding is a risk because much of the feed can be contaminated with pork products that can easily infect the whole pig population. Many farmers use this feeding process, which contributes to the spread of ASF because of the heightened risk. Also, through environmental persistence, ASF survives for months on carcasses and various pork products, allowing for easier transmission when humans are transporting pork products and pigs across borders. Pork products are transported to many locations far apart, allowing the virus to spread widely. There is also an illegal trade of pork products that can be very dangerous for humans handling or consuming the products, and easily transfers to other pig populations. Humans can act as mechanical vectors by traveling to and from farms and moving the ASF with them, infecting countless pig populations. Many farms also do not detect the disease until it is too late, and it spreads to other pigs or farms. The financial struggles and testing for this disease are overlooked. The detection of ASF can cause large economic loss, so the struggle there is not wanting to test because it can only result in loss of money for many farmers if positive. Humans play a role by transferring infected meat, like in the illegal pork trade. Humans also serve as vectors, transmitting the infection from farm to farm through clothing, vehicles, or equipment. Humans do not themselves become infected, but they serve as bridge hosts for multiple animal populations. Biosecurity is a huge challenge when looking at the human role in the spread of this virus due to the mass transport and traveling humans are involved in in the farm and pig industry 

2. Describe how co-infection with Koala retrovirus (KoRV) affects the severity,
progression, and management of Chlamydia in koalas.

KoRV infection causes immunity suppression and is correlated with a higher prevalence of chlamydia infections. When immunity is suppressed by this virus, it is easier for chlamydia to infect the koala because there is less immune defense. The virus brings down the immunity of koalas and can make chlamydia more severe when contracted by a koala, leading to higher mortality rates. When koalas contract KoRV, symptoms are worse with chlamydia, and the bacterial load is greater. It causes greater overall disease severity and prevalence because koalas are more susceptible when they are also infected with KoRV. The body is not able to fight off the disease because of immunosuppression, which allows chlamydia to have rapid progression. This makes it harder to treat due to the wild population and immunosuppression caused by KoRV. This also leads to lower fertility rates and reduced reproduction, affecting the overall population and the environment around them. Coinfection of KoRV and chlamydia leads to more bacteria in the animal, which would need more antibiotic treatments, and this is not good for the koalas because it kills the good bacteria in their gut that they need to break down their food source. The immune system is fighting off two viruses, so the symptoms of chlamydia are worsened, and the koala can experience worse vision loss, wet bottom, and other complications with treatments and relapses of the virus.

3. Snake Fungal Disease (SFD), caused by Ophidiomyces ophiodiicola, is an emerging threat to wild snake populations in North America.
What are the key challenges associated with the surveillance and management of Snake Fungal Disease? 

-SFD is usually asymptomatic within the first month or two, so it spreads before it can be diagnosed; this makes it especially difficult during brumation because the snakes are dormant and the disease can spread without being noticed at all. Fungal spores are also very persistent and can persist in moist soil for long periods, potentially infecting multiple snakes. Snakes are often less closely monitored than other species, and diseases can go undetected and spread more easily across the species. Outbreaks are hard to stop because the prevalence of the disease is noticed too late and has already spread among the snakes. Due to the lack of research, scientists are still not certain about the dynamics behind transmission, so it is hard to stop the spread because the exact modes of transmission are not fully understood. There is also not much research on this species or the disease in particular. Many of the tests yield false negatives and are not very reliable, so it is a tough disease to contain and treat actual positive snakes. Overall, there is really not enough funding that goes into studying or caring for these snakes, so SFD becomes very hard to understand and therefore manage, and has inadequate surveillance. The treatments that are available are only somewhat practical even for domestic snakes, so there are no practical treatments or medications that wild snakes can receive. No treatment is easy to mass distribute to wild snake populations because it is a hands-on procedure to help with the symptoms. The treatments require repetitive cleansing and treating, so for a wild snake, this is not practical at all.

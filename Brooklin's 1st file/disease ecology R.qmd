![](EpiTriad.png)
This image of the EpiTriad shows how three things affect the overall prevalence, transmission, and livelihood of diseases. The environment, host, and pathogen must all come together in a way for a disease to thrive. With certain conditions on each level, the disease can change. 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  	
	1. Find the sample size necessary to detect a disease at or above 5% prevalence in a herd of 5000 deer. The desired level of confidence is 95%
			59
	
	2. Using the hypergeometric distribution, compare the sample size requirements for the following scenarios:
	a. 95% confidence in detecting a disease at 1% prevalence in a large population
		299
	b.99% confidence in detecting a disease at 2% prevalence in a large population 
		229
Both are close to the same number because even though the confidence level goes up, less animals are needed for sampling. You are looking for a higher prevalence rate, so it is easier to detect.

3. You sample 300 deer from a high-fenced facility that has a herd of 300. None of the 4000 deer have antibodies against Epizootic Hemorrhagic Disease. Based on this finding, you are 95% confident that the prevalence of exposure to EHD in this facility is	
>1% because they sampled the right amount, using the table with 95% confidence, the disease should be less than 1% prevalent

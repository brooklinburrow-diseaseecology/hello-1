![](EpiTriad.png)
This image of the EpiTriad shows how three things affect the overall prevalence, transmission, and livelihood of diseases. The environment, host, and pathogen must all come together in a way for a disease to thrive. With certain conditions on each level, the disease can change. 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  	
	1. Find the sample size necessary to detect a disease at or above 5% prevalence in a herd of 5000 deer. The desired level of confidence is 95%
			59
	
	2. Using the hypergeometric distribution, compare the sample size requirements for the following scenarios:
	a. 95% confidence in detecting a disease at 1% prevalence in a large population
		299
	b.99% confidence in detecting a disease at 2% prevalence in a large population 
		229
Both are close to the same number because even though the confidence level goes up, less animals are needed for sampling. You are looking for a higher prevalence rate, so it is easier to detect.

3. You sample 300 deer from a high-fenced facility that has a herd of 300. None of the 4000 deer have antibodies against Epizootic Hemorrhagic Disease. Based on this finding, you are 95% confident that the prevalence of exposure to EHD in this facility is	
>1% because they sampled the right amount, using the table with 95% confidence, the disease should be less than 1% prevalent

a) Find incidence on day 06/12/25, 06/14/25 and 06/15/25. Write the unit for incidence.
(9 points)   
	6/12-  0.0980 cases per elk day
					work- 56-5= 51 new cases-5      5/51=0.098
	6/14- 0.043478 cases per elk day 
					work-56-10=46  new cases- 2     2/46=0.0434
	6/15-  0 cases per elk day 
					work-56-12=44   new cases- 0     2/44=0.0

b) What is the prevalence of conjunctivitis on 06/13/25 and 06/16/25? What is the unit
for prevalence. (5 points)
	6/13- 21.429% prevalence of disease symptoms 
				work- 12/56
	6/16- 8.929% prevalence of disease symptoms 
				work- 5/56
	

c) On which day is the prevalence same as the incidence (except the units)? (3 points)
		on 6/10- prevalence=1.79% incidence=0.179 cases per elk day, because no preexisting cases 																				before this day

d) On which day is the incidence lowest? (3 points)
		On 6/15 and 6/16, there are no new cases, and therefore, the incidence is 0 on both days

Ticks are essential to study and understand due to the various diseases they carry and can transmit to humans. Ticks can latch onto reservoir hosts that are carrying the disease and then transmit it to other hosts, which can be fatal or severe for these hosts. It is essential to investigate how the spread of tick-borne diseases is evolving.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. 
a. False, microparasites do have shorter lives, but they DO reproduce within the host 
d. TRUE,
	The severity of mortality and disease has many determining factors, such as susceptibility, environment, and pathogen characteristics. Therefore, it is not always the case that we see the exact same outbreak characteristics each time; however, it does cause high mortality in white-tailed deer.
f. False, HPS is environmentally transmitted by the human inhaling the aerosolized droppings of an infected rodent 

4. 
c. Calculate beta for measles and Rotavirus
	measles 15/8- 1.875    Rotavirus= 17/14days - 1.21
d. calculate Reff for measles with 80% vax 
			R0(1-0.8)
			1.875(0.2)- 0.375
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. False, MERS-CoV is mostly found in camels and only in human populations with direct physical contact. 
2. TRUE
3. False, some human-human transmission can occur, and while it is not the main transmission, it is not a dead-end because sometimes the illness does transmit to other humans with contact
4. False, the paragraph states 35% of the cases have died, which would be the case fatality rate. 
5. False, this curve shows more of a propagated curve and how the disease is transmitted from human to human.

![](EpiTriad.png)
The Epidemiologic Triad illustrates how the interactions among the host, pathogen, and environment shape disease outcomes. Disease emergence, prevalence, and transmission depend on these three components aligning in ways that support pathogen survival and spread. Changes in any one of these factors can alter disease dynamics.

WORKSHEET 2

1. Find the sample size necessary to detect a disease at or above 5% prevalence in a herd of 5000 deer @95% CONFIDENCE
			59

2. Using the hypergeometric distribution, compare the sample size requirements for the following scenarios:
	a. 95% confidence in detecting a disease at 1% prevalence in a large population: 299
	b.99% confidence in detecting a disease at 2% prevalence in a large population: 229
	Both are close to the same number because, even as the confidence level increases, fewer animals are needed for sampling. You are looking for a higher prevalence rate, which makes it easier to detect.

3. You sample 300 deer from a high-fenced facility that has a herd of 300. None of the 4000 deer have antibodies against Epizootic Hemorrhagic Disease. Based on this finding, you are 95% confident that the prevalence of exposure to EHD in this facility is>1% because they sampled the right amount, using the table with 95% confidence, the disease should be less than 1% prevalent

TICK LAB 

Ticks are essential to study and understand due to the various diseases they carry and can transmit to humans. Ticks can latch onto reservoir hosts that carry the disease and then transmit it to other hosts, which can be fatal or severe. It is essential to investigate how the spread of tick-borne diseases is evolving.

WORKSHEET 5

The first person to become infected in the current Marburg virus outbreak in Rwanda likely contracted the disease during a visit to a cave with Egyptian rousette bats/fruit bats that are known to harbor the Marburg virus. As of 19 December 2024, 66 cases of Marburg virus infection were documented, and most of the people infected were healthcare workers, mainly those who worked in intensive care units.

1. Spillover vs. EID classification
	This Marburg virus outbreak is best classified as a spillover event. The reservoir is the Egyptian rousette bat, and initial human cases likely resulted from exposure in a bat-inhabited cave. Most subsequent infections occurred among healthcare workers caring for infected patients. Because the virus originates in wildlife and jumps into humans rather than circulating persistently within the human population, it meets the definition of spillover.

2. Measures to reduce transmission
	Healthcare settings: patient isolation, PPE use, strict hygiene and sanitation protocols, screening, and quarantining exposed workers.
	Community settings: avoiding bat-inhabited caves, improving public awareness, reducing wildlife contact, and maintaining strong surveillance.

WORKSHEET 7

Nipah Virus
Nipah virus ecology varies by region, influencing how the virus spreads and how prevention is targeted.
	-Malaysia: Transmission occurs primarily from bats → pigs → humans. Pigs act as bridge hosts. Prevention focuses on monitoring pig populations, controlling pig–bat interactions, and preventing contact with contaminated fruit.
	-Bangladesh: Transmission is seasonal and tied to contamination of raw date palm sap by bats. Prevention emphasizes sap protection (e.g., sap pot covers), hygiene, and community education.
	-India: Transmission occurs from bats → humans and between humans. Prevention includes mask use, distancing, sanitation, and early case detection.
	-Philippines: Bat → human transmission is primary. Prevention involves reducing human–bat interactions and using protective equipment when exposure is unavoidable.

Avian Reovirus
	ARV can be transmitted:
		Vertically: from hen to egg
		Horizontally: fecal–oral route, contaminated litter, equipment, or feed
	Environmental factors such as poor ventilation, humidity, contaminated litter, and overcrowding increase environmental persistence and transmission.
	Pathogen characteristics that support transmission include environmental resistance and the ability to survive for weeks in contaminated settings.
	Example disease: Avian reoviruses cause viral arthritis/tenosynovitis in birds, reducing mobility, growth, and survival. Avian reoviruses (ARV) can be transmitted through multiple routes.

Langya henipavirus
	Likely reservoir: shrews
	Transmission route: spillover from infected shrews to humans through direct or indirect contact.
LayV is a spillover event, not an emerging infectious disease, because it does not transmit between humans. Each infection represents an independent spillover, and humans serve as dead-end hosts.

WORKSHEET 8

Overall prevalence: 47.2% (CI: 37.4–57.1). Nearly half the sampled raccoons carried at least one roundworm.
Regional patterns:
	North: 28.6% (0.171–0.425)
	South: 62.8% (0.466–0.764)
	Central: 64.3% (0.346–0.868)
Differences among regions were statistically significant (p = 0.00178). Warmer climates likely support higher parasite survival, contributing to higher prevalence in southern and central areas. Given that environments play an important role in pathogen virulence and prevalence, the lower numbers in the northern regions compared to the south or central regions could indicate an environmental issue. Further, this suggests that raccoons exhibit different behavioral or habitat traits that account for differences between regions. Looking further into the data, central numbers could be affected by the small sample size, which could also coincide with the large confidence interval.
 Females have nearly double the prevalence of these roundworms than males do. Raccoons may show different behavioral and lifestyle patterns by gender, which could account for the differences in these numbers.    

Age patterns
	Young: 28% (0.169–0.422)
	Adults: 64.3% (0.509–0.763)
	Although adults show higher prevalence, age differences were not statistically significant (p = 0.228). Region and sex appear to be stronger drivers.

Sex patterns
	Males: 38% (0.272–0.496)
	Females: 65% (0.498–0.780)
	Sex differences were statistically significant (p = 0.0136). Female raccoons consistently had higher prevalence, potentially due to behavioral or physiological factors.

Regional × sex interactions
Clear patterns emerged:
	-Southern and central females showed extremely high prevalence (approaching 100%), with smaller sample sizes influencing CI width.
	-Northern populations showed lower and more similar prevalence across sexes, reinforcing environmental influences.
	CENTRAL 
		Male prevalence: 44.4% (0.137- 0.788)
		Female: 100% (0.478 -0.100)
	SOUTH
		Male: 50.0% (0.319 - 0.681)
		Female: 100% (0.715 - 0.100)
	NORTH
		Male: 21.4% (0.083 - 0.409)
		Female: 38.1% (0.181 - 0.616)

Regional x age interactions
	CENTRAL
		Young: 100% (0.207-1.00), (sample size of 1) 
		Adults: 61.5% (0.355-0.823)
	SOUTH
		Young: 50% (0.254-0.746) 
		Adult prevalence: 67.7% (0.501-0.814)
	NORTH:
		Young: 29.2% (0.149 - 0.492)
		Adults: 28% (0.143 - 0.476)

Interpretation
Regional climate and environmental conditions appear to be the primary drivers of roundworm prevalence. Sex-based differences were also substantial. These findings point to targeted management in warmer regions and to further research into sex-based susceptibility. North is the outlier with much lower prevalence, so further research into eradicating roundworm infections could focus on warmer climates and on what exactly is causing higher prevalence in those areas. The same could be said for females, researching differences between males and females and looking into which differences could be the cause for higher prevalence and how. Education could be focused on individuals in warmer climates who are at higher risk of infection to limit spillover and further spread. Humans could also pose a risk of spreading these parasites in warmer climates due to increased activity and greater exposure opportunities. Since female infections are more prevalent in each region, their populations could be targeted more for testing and treatment, but this is a challenge because the populations are wild rather than domesticated.

WORKSHEET 9

Specific human behaviors contributing to the zoonotic spread: 

Three major behaviors increased zoonotic transmission risk:
		1. Poor hygiene practices (e.g., not washing hands after handling birds or eggs). Salmonella persists on surfaces and easily spreads through indirect contact. There is no regulation on proper channels or cleansing when eggs or poultry are coming straight from the backyard or being sold to the community.
		2. Close, pet-like interactions with poultry, especially by children. Birds may appear healthy while shedding Salmonella, leading to direct transmission.
		3. Transporting contamination into homes via shoes, clothing, equipment, and pets. Backyard poultry owners may unintentionally act as bridge hosts. 

Broader human-driven ecological factors, such as habitat disruption and increased bird density in urban settings, also intensify transmission risk. Humans disturb the ecosystems where birds live by urbanizing and taking their habitats. Removing habitats from birds can lead to denser populations, where Salmonella can spread quickly and easily. Infected birds' droplets are the main way Salmonella spreads, so putting these birds in an environment where contamination is likely to be much higher, due to less space to spread out, will lead to the disease spreading faster. Urbanization as a whole increases interactions and contamination between animals and humans, leading to more infections. 
Many humans are also unaware of the threat bird feeders pose to Salmonella. People who are changing out bird feeders or pets with access to them are exposed to sites where many wild birds have cross-contaminated, which could make it a hotspot for salmonella. Hand hygiene is essential for limiting human contamination of Salmonella. Overall, the public's lack of education and hygiene regarding this topic and the ways contamination occurs leads to further human infections. Backyard poultry owners traveling to other animal environments further spread infection to these animals and could serve as a bridge to other humans. CDC and health officials are trying to educate the public on basic practices such as proper hygiene, not moving items from the coop to different locations, and improving the transfer of germs from the coop into the home, especially by kids. Still, many people are not aware of how this spreads or do not take the time to self-regulate when it comes to small backyard flocks.

2. Tall fescue grass is commonly infected with a fungal endophyte (Epichloë coenophiala) that produces ergot alkaloids associated with fescue toxicosis in grazing livestock.

	a. What advantage does Tall fescue gain from being infected with a fungal
       endophyte? 
		-The grass can grow in conditions where it could not previously grow without the fungal endophyte. It allows the grass to thrive by producing alkaloids that make it more tolerant of its environment, including drought, insects, and poor soil. This allows the grass species to dominate other species around it and persist in many environments. The grass is durable, drought-resistant, easy to establish, regrows quickly, and is suitable for grazing by big herds. This makes the grass tolerant to weather changes. Their relationship is mutualistic; the endophyte enhances root growth and depth, increases tolerance to various conditions, and makes the plant more durable, giving it a competitive advantage.   

	b. What environmental and ecological factors drive the occurrence and severity of
       Fescue toxicosis in grazing systems? 
		-High temperatures and drought stress increase alkaloid production. Drought reduces soil nutrient levels, so alkaloids are produced as a protective mechanism. Soil fertility and microbial communities affect endophyte expression. Overgrazing affects toxin accumulation and disease risk. The cows eat the part of the plant that is most dense in toxins because of overgrazing. If the grass type is dominant in the pasture, it also prevents grazing systems from eating anything other than this grass. Soil fertility and moisture levels can also increase the toxin levels, especially if conditions make it easier for the grass to overdominate the pasture. Soil makeup can also feed toxic alkaloids, depending on whether the soil is rich in nitrogen or other components the alkaloids feed on. The soil microbiome shows a correlation with the severity of toxicosis. The toxicity impairs cattle's ability to regulate their temperature, and warmer conditions exacerbate this, while alkoid concentrations are higher in the grass in warmer environments. The toxicity impairs the cattle's heat regulation, so in warmer weather, they are already struggling to dissipate heat; now, the toxicosis makes this even more difficult. Climate conditions (heat, drought, season change) can lead to plant changes (nutrient stress, no moisture) which can lead to more endophytes produced in the grass which can lead to alkoloid concentrations increasing which leads to more cattle eating the toxicity and then you can see livestock outcome conditions exasterbated by the climate as well; it is all a chain of events.

	c. Key clinical signs 
		-Cattle look malnourished, with weight loss, rough and discolored hair coats, and poor performance. Clinical signs: fever, lethargy, swelling, and coat abnormalities. Cattle have more difficulty dissipating heat in hot climates and may show signs such as seeking shade or increased water intake. Cows eat less because their metabolism is affected. Lipid and carbohydrate metabolism are reduced, which will affect eating patterns. Immune function is also affected, and cows are at higher risk of contracting illnesses that could be fatal.

WORKSHEET 10

1. What are the different routes of transmission for African Swine fever? What role do humans play in the spread and transmission of ASF? 

-ASF transmits through vectors (tick bites), direct contact with an infected pig, and indirect contact via contaminated sources such as feed, trucks transporting infected feed or pigs, or equipment or clothing. Swill feeding is a risk because much of the feed can be contaminated with pork products that can easily infect the whole pig population. Many farmers use this feeding practice, which contributes to the spread of ASF due to the heightened risk. Also, through environmental persistence, ASF can survive for months on carcasses and various pork products, facilitating easier transmission when humans transport pork products and pigs across borders. Pork products are transported to many locations far apart, allowing the virus to spread widely. There is also an illegal trade of pork products that can be very dangerous for humans handling or consuming the products, and easily transfers to other pig populations. Humans can act as mechanical vectors by traveling to and from farms and moving the ASF with them, infecting countless pig populations. Many farms also do not detect the disease until it is too late, and it spreads to other pigs or farms. The financial struggles and testing for this disease are overlooked. The detection of ASF can cause considerable economic losses, so the battle there is not worth testing, as it could only result in financial losses for many farmers if positive. Humans play a role by transferring infected meat, like in the illegal pork trade. Humans also serve as vectors, transmitting the infection from farm to farm through clothing, vehicles, or equipment. Humans do not themselves become infected, but they serve as bridge hosts for multiple animal populations. Biosecurity is a considerable challenge when looking at the human role in the spread of this virus due to the mass transport and traveling humans are involved in in the farm and pig industry 

2. Describe how co-infection with Koala retrovirus (KoRV) affects the severity,
progression, and management of Chlamydia in koalas.

-KoRV infection causes immunity suppression and is correlated with a higher prevalence of chlamydia infections. When this virus suppresses immunity, it is easier for chlamydia to infect koalas because their immune defenses are weakened. The virus brings down the immunity of koalas and can make chlamydia more severe when contracted by a koala, leading to higher mortality rates. When koalas contract KoRV, symptoms are worse with chlamydia, and the bacterial load is greater. It causes greater overall disease severity and prevalence because koalas are more susceptible when they are also infected with KoRV. The body is not able to fight off the disease because of immunosuppression, which allows chlamydia to have rapid progression. This makes it harder to treat due to the wild population and immunosuppression caused by KoRV. This also leads to lower fertility rates and reduced reproduction, affecting the overall population and the environment. Coinfection with KoRV and chlamydia leads to increased bacterial loads in the animal, which require more antibiotic treatments, and this is not good for koalas because it kills the good bacteria in their gut that help break down their food. The immune system is fighting off two viruses, so the symptoms of chlamydia are worsened, and the koala can experience worse vision loss, wet bottom, and other complications with treatments and relapses of the virus.

3. Snake Fungal Disease (SFD), caused by Ophidiomyces ophiodiicola, is an emerging threat to wild snake populations in North America.
What are the key challenges associated with the surveillance and management of Snake Fungal Disease? 

-SFD is usually asymptomatic within the first month or two, so it spreads before it can be diagnosed; this makes it especially difficult during brumation because the snakes are dormant and the disease can spread without being noticed at all. Fungal spores are also very persistent and can persist in moist soil for long periods, potentially infecting multiple snakes. Snakes are often less closely monitored than other species, and diseases can go undetected and spread more easily among them. Outbreaks are hard to stop because the disease's prevalence is recognized too late, and it has already spread among the snakes. Due to limited research, scientists are still unsure about the dynamics of transmission, making it hard to stop the spread because the exact modes of transmission are not fully understood. There is also not much research on this species or the disease in particular. Many of the tests yield false negatives and are not very reliable, so it is a tough disease to contain and treat actual positive snakes. Overall, there is not enough funding for studying or caring for these snakes, so SFD becomes very hard to understand and manage, and surveillance is inadequate. The treatments available are only somewhat effective even for domestic snakes, so there are no practical treatments or medications that wild snakes can receive. No treatment is easy to mass-distribute to wild snake populations, as it is a hands-on procedure to address symptoms. The treatments require repetitive cleansing and treating, so for a wild snake, this is not practical at all.  


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. 
a. False- The in-between species transmission is low to sustain the pathogen, but there is still some within-species transmission; otherwise, these species would be dead-end hosts. High between-species transmission would also be lower because a high spillover rate could likely lead to an outbreak; instead, each spillover is independent and more spread out. 

b. False- contagious requires direct contact transmission, but it can be infectious only by vectors still. 

c. False - eggs must be in the external environment for 2-4 weeks before becoming infective 

d. TRUE

e. TRUE

2. 
a. straws- straws are being created and distributed to these populations to stop the ingestion of these water fleas, stopping the step to them maturing in the small intestine and spreading further to other hosts.
b. Wells- building separate wells, for drinking purposes only, where dogs or humans are not sticking extremities into, to stop the beginning of the cycle where the worms are depositing the eggs and spreading them to the people drinking out of the same water.
c. treating the water with chemicals- kills the intermediate host, stopping the ingestion of the water fleas with the larvae.
d. surveillance and education- catching the cases before they can further be spread is only possible with adequate surveillance, and educating these populations to not get into drinking water sources if their limb is burning, but instead put it in an isolated bucket, bandage the wound, and only drink out of trusted sources of water. 

Following recent dog infections, fish were identified as the likely source of infection, and dogs were tethered and unable to reach the drinking water source. Some tethered specific water sources to prevent animal access, and surveillance of not just humans but also animals was increased to catch cases before they spread further. 


3.
CWD is hard to eradicate and control because the prions persist in the environment for long periods of time, which causes several indirect transmissions. CWD can also spread through direct contact with infected animals, so both sources must be eliminated to eradicate the disease. The animals that do spread this disease are asymptomatic for 16 months, allowing CWD to spread before they can be diagnosed and contained. By the time the disease is detected in one host, the disease has already spread to many other surfaces in the environment and infected multiple hosts. There is also no vaccination or treatment, which puts more weight on the surveillance and containment of infected populations. Even when signs are seen there is no effective testing to ensure these deers are infected and should be eradicated. The migration patterns and spread of these deer allow the pathogen to spread in a wide area, making containment difficult. Humans also contribute to the spread with bad disposal or movement of the carcases, allowing the prions to stay and move wherever the vehicle goes, along with the carcass. The array of different human, environmental, and biological factors contributing to the spread of this disease makes it very difficult to contain.

8. 
The downside of using the hypergeometric distribution is that it only truly works if the random and probabilistic sampling process is used. The system assumes that samples were attained randomly, with accurate cases and no clustering of the disease. Since all samples are from hunters, this could easily be a clustered sample from good hunting spots and certain regions. The actual population is likely missed because many areas where deer live are not accessible or reasonable hunting grounds. If the disease is localized to a certain source point, the majority of cases could be missed, and prevalence could inaccurately be projected to be much lower. The disease could be clustered in a different region than where the samples are coming from. The 0.2% prevalence is likely estimated much lower than the true prevalence, and assumptions must be accurately met to try and use hypergeometric distribution methods.

dead-end host - humans 
	A parasite does not mature or spread any further when it infects a human, and they are infected accidentally. 
paratenic host- Seafish 
	The larval stage survives but does not further develop
	They can act as a bridge between intermediate and definitive when dolphins eat an infected seafish. 
intermediate host-crustaceans  
	Eggs are ingested by these hosts and mature into a more mature phase.
definitive host- dolphins
	The parasite reproduces in these hosts and is shed through the eggs laid. 

11. Infected does not always mean diseased. Infected but not diseased is possible, and white tail deer is a prime example. White-tailed deer can be reservoir hosts that become infected but not diseased and spread the disease through an intermediate host, such as ticks. A host must be infected to become diseased, and infection can lead to disease, but not in every case. Infection does not, however, mean contagious, but transmission can occur from infected hosts and cause more disease. SARS-CoV-2 is another example of an illness that, while it can cause illness, not every infection results in clinical signs showing. Using the antelopes as an example, they were infected with the pathogen for some time but never showed clinical signs until the environment changed and the pathogen dynamics changed with it. This is a key factor in the transmission of diseases because the spread of many diseases is harder to contain when hosts who have not been diagnosed or contained spread the virus. 

12. 60% would need to be vaccinated 
13. 
The main challenges in managing wildlife diseases stem from the fact that these populations are wild and not handled in the same ways as domesticated animals are. They are harder to treat, harder to research, and harder to contain and detect cases. The complexity of wildlife diseases is also very troubling. In Saiga antelopes, the disease did not manifest until the appropriate environment was introduced. This is why the epidemiology triad is so importan,t because a disease must be approached from all angles. The pathogen had infected the host, but until the stressful birthing season and the hot environment were present, the disease did not actually occur. Even when scientists figured out what caused the mass mortality event due to these factors coming together and causing the disease, there was no real solution. Humans can not stop migration patterns or weather, so the only solution for many wildlife diseases is to maintain and control the confounding factors that contribute to endangerment. For these antelopes, poaching policies or education about them could be a start, but vaccination and treatment are never efficient solutions for wild animals. Snake fungal disease is also a good example of how disease complexity, lack of control, and limited funds contribute to how easily these diseases spread. The incubation period and lack of surveillance for this disease in snakes allow it to spread during brumation or dormancy periods before it can be detected. Many pathogens are highly persistent in the environment, and due to limited research, many wildlife diseases lack resources to understand their transmission dynamics, and ways to eradicate them have not been studied enough. When treatments are found or solutions to limit human-to-human spread are developed, they sometimes become the biggest problem. Humans contribute to the spread of many pathogens, such as Salmonella, and backyard poultry farmers sometimes lack proper education on disease transmission or refuse to comply with scientists' solutions. Many treatments are also not easy to mass-distribute to animals, and many require multiple treatments and surveillance that wild animals don't have access to. There is no single good model or way to treat each disease because each has different components, solutions, confounding factors, and there is not enough surveillance, funding, and research to support proper management.
